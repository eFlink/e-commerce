# E-commerce Website

Welcome to the repository of my custom e-commerce website platform built with cutting-edge web technologies. This project integrates a variety of tools and frameworks, including React, Next.js, Drizzle, Vercel, Clerk, tRPC, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and more. 

## Technologies

This project is built using several modern web technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- Drizzle: A collection of front-end libraries that make writing dApp frontends easier and more predictable.
- Vercel: A platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.
- Clerk: A complete user management solution, providing authentication, authorization, and user management.
- tRPC: End-to-end typesafe APIs made easy.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

Future integrations may include Stripe for payment processing capabilities.
